# This is an MCP Cases file. It contains a list of test cases in YAML format.
# Each test case has variable number of inputs (keyst starting with 'in') and outputs (keys starting with 'out').
# The test cases are separated by '---' (three dashes) on a new line, making it multi-document YAML file.

# File name must end with '_test.yaml' to be recognized as a test for foxytest, but we also use it to generate the mock itself.
